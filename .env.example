# NOTE: Environment variables are no longer used!
# The sampling service now uses a configuration-based approach.
# Please refer to the README.md for configuration examples.
#
# Example configuration:
#
# const service = new SamplingService({
#   openRouter: {
#     apiKey: "your-api-key-here",
#     defaultModel: "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"
#   }
# });
